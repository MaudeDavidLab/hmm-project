In order to search for new homologues using Profile HMM we will be using profiles that have already been built for this paper and we will be searching the file
samples.fasta

To search the sequence databse, the command will look like this:
> hmmsearch <hmmFilename> samples.fasta > hmmsamples.out

After we observe the output and discuus the different sections that it comes in.
The first section of the output file is the header. It has all of the infromation on what program you ran, on what and with what options

INSERT HEADER HERE

The second section is the Sequence top hits list. It is a list of top hits(sorted by e-value, most significant hit first) formatted in a BLAST- like style

INSERT INFO HERE

The first field in this section is the name of the target sequence, that is followed by the description. The last three bits are the raw score, the total e-value and the total number of domains detected in the sequence.
