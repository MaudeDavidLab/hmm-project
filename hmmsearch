In order to search for new homologues using Profile HMM we will be using profiles that have already been built for this paper and we will be searching the file
samples.fasta

To search the sequence databse, the command will look like this:
> hmmsearch <hmmFilename> samples.fasta > hmmsamples.out

After we observe the output and discuus the different sections that it comes in.
